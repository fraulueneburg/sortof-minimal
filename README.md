# SortOf minimal

MVP experiment for my project [sortof – The To Do App for chaotic people](https://github.com/fraulueneburg/sortof). Turns out, building an app with exactly ONE list of free draggable items, while all other lists display tasks vertically, is harder than I thought.

BUT I did it and now I understand ALL the measurements that [@dndkit](https://github.com/clauderic/dnd-kit) provides and my items now position smoothly on the list, no matter where I grabbed them with my mouse. Can’t wait to implement these changes into my final project.
