# SortOf minimal

MVP experiment for my project [sortof – The To Do App for chaotic people](https://github.com/fraulueneburg/sortof). Turns out, building an app with exactly ONE list of free draggable tasks, while all other tasks display vertically, is harder than one thinks.

But working through this was SO worth it. Not only did it provide me with a deeper understanding of [@dndkit](https://github.com/clauderic/dnd-kit), it also ensured that my items now free-position smoothly within the first list, regardless of where I grab them with my mouse.

There’s no demo for this MVP, but you can check out the repo of the non-MVP here: [sortof](https://github.com/fraulueneburg/sortof)
